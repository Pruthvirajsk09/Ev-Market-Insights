# Project Overview
This project presents an interactive solution developed for AtliQ Motors, an automotive giant specializing in electric vehicles (EVs) based in the USA. As part of its expansion
into the Indian market, AtliQ Motors aimed to perform a detailed market study of the existing EV and Hybrid vehicle segment in India, where their current market share is less
than 2%.

The solution provides a comprehensive analysis of the Indian EV/Hybrid market, focusing on vehicle registrations, regional trends, customer demographics, and market
opportunities. It is designed to support the decision-making of the AtliQ Motors India leadership, especially the Chief, Bruce Haryali, enabling them to strategize the product
launch effectively.


# Project Introduction
As the global shift towards electric mobility accelerates, understanding the regional market landscape is critical for successful expansion. AtliQ Motors has built a significant
presence in North America but faces challenges in India, where its market share remains marginal.

This project involves a detailed data-driven analysis of the Indian EV/Hybrid market using a sample dataset provided by Vahan Sewa. The objective is to answer key primary and
secondary questions regarding vehicle registrations, geographic distribution, customer preferences, and industry growth patterns.

The analysis is presented in an intuitive, easy-to-understand dashboard, designed for business stakeholders to explore and interpret independently. The goal is to deliver
actionable insights that inform AtliQ Motors’ strategy to successfully enter and grow in the Indian market.


# Project Steps

### 1) Understand the Business Problem
The task was to analyze the Indian EV/Hybrid market to assist AtliQ Motors India in planning the launch of bestselling models in India.

### 2) Data Collection and Exploration

Utilized a dataset provided by Stakeholder containing vehicle registration data across India.
Performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, standardize data types, and remove inconsistencies.

### 3) Answer Primary and Secondary Questions
Referred to the document containing primary and secondary questions and conducted detailed exploratory analysis to answer them, focusing on:

Total EV/Hybrid registrations over time

Distribution of vehicle types and models

Regional (state-wise) vehicle penetration


### 4) Develop Interactive Visual Solution
Designed a self-explanatory, interactive dashboard that presents key metrics and visualizations, enabling the leadership to analyze:

EV and Hybrid vehicle growth trends

Geographic distribution and market penetration

Manufacturer-wise and model-wise breakdown

Year-on-year trends and insights

### 5) Generate Actionable Insights
Summarized findings to highlight:

Regions with highest EV/Hybrid adoption

Key models driving growth

Market segments with low penetration presenting opportunities

Strategic recommendations to enter the market based on data insights


# ⭐ Top 10 Key Findings

### 1. Total EV Sales across India have reached 2 Million units, with a penetration rate of 3.61% in the overall vehicle market.

### 2. The total vehicle sales projection by 2030 is 54.21 Million units, with Maharashtra, Kerala, and Uttar Pradesh expected to be the top three states in terms of projected EV sales.

### 3. Maharashtra leads in both EV sales and penetration rate, with 13.35M projected EV sales by 2030 and a penetration rate of 6.49%.

### 4. Karnataka shows the highest growth rate (CAGR of 25.28%) among top states, indicating strong future growth potential.

### 5. Bottom 10 States by EV Sales include regions like Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, with some having as low as zero sales, highlighting major market gaps.

### 6. Among vehicle makers, OLA Electric dominates with 489K units sold, followed by TVS (273K) and Ather (204K).

### 7. OLA Electric shows an outstanding CAGR of 373.22%, leading the rapid growth in the EV maker segment, followed by TVS at 330.80% CAGR.

### 8. Hero Electric shows a negative CAGR (-58.52%), indicating a significant decline in sales over time.

### 9. 2-Wheelers account for 92.6% of total EV sales, far surpassing 4-Wheelers (7.4%), which points to a strong market preference for smaller EVs.

### 10. Quarterly sales trends reveal steady growth, with the highest EV sales observed in Q4, indicating seasonal factors or strategic pushes by makers during this period.


# Recommendations

### 1) Focus Market Entry in High-Potential States
Prioritize expansion efforts in states like Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka, where EV adoption and penetration rates are already strong and projected to grow significantly
by 2030.

### 2) Strengthen Infrastructure in Low-Adoption Regions
Target regions with low EV sales (e.g., Sikkim, Nagaland, Andaman & Nicobar) by collaborating with local governments and infrastructure providers to expand charging networks and provide financial incentives, helping overcome barriers to entry.

### 3) Emphasize 2-Wheeler EV Segments
Given that 92.6% of EV sales are 2-wheelers, AtliQ Motors should focus on enhancing their 2-wheeler product lineup and promoting these models aggressively in urban and semi-urban markets where demand is highest.

### 4) Leverage High-Growth Makers’ Strategies
Study and replicate successful strategies from high-growth makers such as OLA Electric and TVS, especially their marketing, distribution, and customer engagement practices.

### 5) Address Declining Maker Segments
Investigate the factors behind the negative CAGR of Hero Electric, and consider restructuring or repositioning its product offerings to better align with market needs.

### 6) Offer Financing and Incentives
Given the low penetration in some regions, AtliQ Motors should offer easy financing options and government-subsidized pricing models to reduce upfront costs and increase accessibility.

### 7) Launch Strategic Campaigns in Q4
Since quarterly data shows Q4 as the peak sales period, focus marketing efforts and product launches during this window to maximize visibility and sales impact.

### 8) Expand Data-Driven Decision Making
Continuously update the dashboard with fresh data and market trends to help the strategy team monitor real-time adoption patterns and adjust strategies accordingly.
