# Project Overview
This project presents an interactive solution developed for AtliQ Motors, an automotive giant specializing in electric vehicles (EVs) based in the USA. As part of its expansion
into the Indian market, AtliQ Motors aimed to perform a detailed market study of the existing EV and Hybrid vehicle segment in India, where their current market share is less
than 2%.

The solution provides a comprehensive analysis of the Indian EV/Hybrid market, focusing on vehicle registrations, regional trends, customer demographics, and market
opportunities. It is designed to support the decision-making of the AtliQ Motors India leadership, especially the Chief, Bruce Haryali, enabling them to strategize the product
launch effectively.


# Project Introduction
As the global shift towards electric mobility accelerates, understanding the regional market landscape is critical for successful expansion. AtliQ Motors has built a significant
presence in North America but faces challenges in India, where its market share remains marginal.

This project involves a detailed data-driven analysis of the Indian EV/Hybrid market using a sample dataset provided by Vahan Sewa. The objective is to answer key primary and
secondary questions regarding vehicle registrations, geographic distribution, customer preferences, and industry growth patterns.

The analysis is presented in an intuitive, easy-to-understand dashboard, designed for business stakeholders to explore and interpret independently. The goal is to deliver
actionable insights that inform AtliQ Motors’ strategy to successfully enter and grow in the Indian market.
